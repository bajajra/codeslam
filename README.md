### Idea for the developement of this project:

I always had the passion to spread the knowledge of programming accross masses. Whenever I would find any new things, I just told my friends about it. Now, in order to spread a coding culture accross my college, I just decided to build something that is fun for the college students as well as acts as a challenge for me.
